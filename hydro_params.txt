## Physical parameters
# simulation box dimensions
box:
  anchor: [-0.5 m, -0.5 m, -0.5 m]
  sides: [1. m, 1. m, 1. m]
# grid resolution
ncell: [128, 128, 128]
# system time step
timestep: 0.001 s

## Algorithm parameters
# number of subgrids
# this is a coarser version of the total grid and determines the way the grid is
# split across different threads and processes
# in the current implementation, the coarse grid resolution numbers should be
# factors of the total grid resolution, to make sure all subgrids have the same
# resolution
# for good performance, the total number of subgrids should be significantly
# larger than the number of threads used for the run
num_subgrid: [8, 8, 8]
