/**
 * This file contains a very simple parallel algorithm with uncoordinated
 * communication. The idea is that we have a 1D grid of cells, with each cell
 * having 2 neighbouring cells (periodially wrapped at the edges).
 * Each cell holds an integer value, which is initialised to the same value for
 * all cells. Each cell also has a unique random sequence assigned to it (you
 * could think of it as each cell having a unique random generator that will
 * always produce the same random sequence for that specific cell).
 *
 * The algorithm we perform is very simple:
 * as long as a cell has a positive non-zero value for its integer variable:
 *   - we subtract 1 from the integer variable
 *   - we draw a random number (the next random number in the sequence)
 *   - what happens next depends on that random number:
 *       - if that random number is smaller than some constant value, we
 *         increase the integer variable for one of its 2 neighbours with 1,
 *         with a 50% probability of choosing one or the other
 *       - if that random number is larger, we do nothing
 * For each iteration of the above loop, we add 1 to an interaction counter.
 * Once all cells have completed the loop, we compute the average number of
 * interactions per cell. Theoretically, this number should be
 * \f[
 *   \langle{} N_{int} \rangle{} = \sum_{i=0}^{N} N p^i,
 * \f]
 * with \f$N\f$ the starting value of the integer variable, and \f$p\f$ the
 * threshold probability for increasing a neighbour counter.
 *
 * This algorithm is tricky to parallelize, as we have neighbour interactions
 * across nodes between some cells, and we do not a priori know how many of
 * those we will have. Furthermore, cells or even entire processes that already
 * finished could be woken up again by an interaction with a neighbouring cell.
 * We do know how many interactions have been generated at any given time, and
 * how many completed, and we can use this information to deduce how many cells
 * are still active. This can be used to set up an uncoordinated communication
 * scheme.
