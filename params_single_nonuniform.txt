# simulation box dimensions
box:
  anchor: [-5. pc, -5. pc, -5. pc]
  sides: [10. pc, 10. pc, 10. pc]
# grid resolution
ncell: [128, 128, 128]
# number of photon packets
num_photon: 1e7
# number of iterations
number_of_iterations: 10
# reemission probability (realistic value: 0.364)
reemission_probability: 0.
# number of sources (a single source is always placed at the origin and has a
# 10 times higher luminosity)
number_of_sources: 1
# generate a random density field (if false, a uniform density is used)
random_density: true

## Algorithm parameters
# number of subgrids
# this is a coarser version of the total grid and determines the way the grid is
# split across different threads and processes
# in the current implementation, the coarse grid resolution numbers should be
# factors of the total grid resolution, to make sure all subgrids have the same
# resolution
# for good performance, the total number of subgrids should be significantly
# larger than the number of threads used for the run
num_subgrid: [8, 8, 8]
# number of tasks that can be stored in the queue for a single thread
# the code will crash if more tasks are assigned to a thread at any given
# moment
queue_size_per_thread: 100
# number of photon buffers that can be stored simultaneously
# the code will crash if more photon buffers are needed at any given moment
memoryspace_size: 50000
# total number of tasks that can be performed by all threads together during
# a single iteration of the algorithm
# the code will crash if the total number of tasks exceeds this number
number_of_tasks: 500000
# size of the MPI communication buffer (in number of photon buffers)
# the code will crash if a larger buffer is needed at any given point during the
# simulation
MPI_buffer_size: 1000
# inverse fraction of the work load per thread that can be taken by a single
# subgrid. If the work load for a subgrid exceeds this limit, the subgrid will
# be split across multiple copies that can be processed independently
# setting this number to a value less than 1 will disable subgrid copies
# to get reasonable performance, this value should be at least > 2
# note that larger values will require more memory to run
cost_copy_factor: 10
edge_copy_factor: 0.01
# size of the general queue that is shared by all threads
general_queue_size: 100000
